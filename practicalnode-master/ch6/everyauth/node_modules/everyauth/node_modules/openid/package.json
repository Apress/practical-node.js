  "readme": "# OpenID for Node.js\r\n\r\nOpenID for Node.js is (yes, you guessed it) an OpenID implementation for Node.js. \r\n\r\nHighlights and features include:\r\n\r\n- Full OpenID 1.0/1.1/2.0 compliant Relying Party (client) implementation\r\n- Very simple API\r\n- Simple extension points for association state\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe library can be [reviewed and retrieved from GitHub](http://github.com/havard/node-openid).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIf you use [`npm`](http://npmjs.org), simply do `npm install openid`.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you can grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/havard/node-openid).\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nHere's a very simple server using OpenID for Node.js for authentication:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar openid = require('openid');\r\nvar url = require('url');\r\nvar querystring = require('querystring');\r\nvar relyingParty = new openid.RelyingParty(\r\n    'http://example.com/verify', // Verification URL (yours)\r\n    null, // Realm (optional, specifies realm for OpenID authentication)\r\n    false, // Use stateless verification\r\n    false, // Strict mode\r\n    []); // List of extensions to enable and include\r\n\r\n\r\nvar server = require('http').createServer(\r\n    function(req, res)\r\n    {\r\n        var parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url);\r\n        if(parsedUrl.pathname == '/authenticate')\r\n        { \r\n          // User supplied identifier\r\n          var query = querystring.parse(parsedUrl.query);\r\n          var identifier = query.openid_identifier;\r\n\r\n          // Resolve identifier, associate, and build authentication URL\r\n          relyingParty.authenticate(identifier, false, function(error, authUrl)\r\n              {\r\n                if (error)\r\n                {\r\n                  res.writeHead(200);\r\n                  res.end('Authentication failed: ' + error.message);\r\n                }\r\n                else if (!authUrl)\r\n                {\r\n                  res.writeHead(200);\r\n                  res.end('Authentication failed');\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                {\r\n                  res.writeHead(302, { Location: authUrl });\r\n                  res.end();\r\n                }\r\n              });\r\n        }\r\n        else if(parsedUrl.pathname == '/verify')\r\n        {\r\n            // Verify identity assertion\r\n            // NOTE: Passing just the URL is also possible\r\n            relyingParty.verifyAssertion(req, function(error, result)\r\n            {\r\n              res.writeHead(200);\r\n              res.end(!error && result.authenticated \r\n                  ? 'Success :)'\r\n                  : 'Failure :(');\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            // Deliver an OpenID form on all other URLs\r\n            res.writeHead(200);\r\n            res.end('<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>'\r\n                + '<form method=\"get\" action=\"/authenticate\">'\r\n                + '<p>Login using OpenID</p>'\r\n                + '<input name=\"openid_identifier\" />'\r\n                + '<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\" />'\r\n                + '</form></body></html>');\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\nserver.listen(80);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more elaborate example including extensions can be found in `sample.js` in the GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n## Supported Extensions\r\nThis library comes with built-in support for the following OpenID extensions:\r\n\r\n - The Simple Registration (SREG) 1.1 extension is implemented as `openid.SimpleRegistration`.\r\n - The Attribute Exchange (AX) 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.AttributeExchange`.\r\n - The OAuth 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.OAuthHybrid`.\r\n - The User Interface 1.0 extension is implemented as `openid.UserInterface`.\r\n - The Provider Authentication Policy Extension 1.0 (PAPE) is implemented as `openid.pape`.\r\n\r\n## Storing association state\r\n\r\nTo provide a way to save/load association state, you need to mix-in two functions in\r\nthe `openid` module:\r\n\r\n - `saveAssociation(provider, type, handle, secret, expiry_time_in_seconds, callback)` is called when a new association is established during authentication. The callback should be called with any error as its first argument (or `null` if no error occured).\r\n - `loadAssociation(handle, callback)` is used to retrieve the association identified by `handle` when verification happens. The callback should be called with any error as its first argument (and `null` as the second argument), or an object with the keys `provider`, `type`, `secret` if the association was loaded successfully.\r\n\r\nThe `openid` module includes default implementations for these functions using a simple object to store the associations in-memory.\r\n\r\n## Caching discovered information\r\n\r\nThe verification of a positive assertion (i.e. an authenticated user) can be sped up significantly by avoiding the need for additional provider discoveries when possible. In order to achieve, this speed-up, node-openid needs to cache its discovered providers. You can mix-in two functions to override the default cache, which is an in-memory cache utilizing a simple object store:\r\n  \r\n  - `saveDiscoveredInformation(key, provider, callback)` is used when saving a discovered provider.  The following behavior is required:\r\n    - The `key` parameter should be uses as a key for storing the provider - it will be used as the lookup key when loading the provider. (Currently, the key is either a claimed identifier or an OP-local identifier, depending on the OpenID context.)\r\n    - When saving fails for some reason, `callback(error)` is called with `error` being an error object specifying what failed.\r\n    - When saving succeeds, `callback(null)` is called.\r\n\r\n  - `loadDiscoveredInformation(key, callback)` is used to load any previously discovered information about the provider for an identifier. The following behavior is required:    \r\n      - When no provider is found for the identifier, `callback(null, null)` is called (i.e. it is not an error to not have any data to return).\r\n      - When loading fails for some reason, `callback(error, null)` is called with `error` being an error string specifying why loading failed.\r\n      - When loading succeeds, `callback(null, provider)` is called with the exact provider object that was previously stored using `saveDiscoveredInformation`.\r\n\r\n## Proxy Support\r\n`node-openid` makes HTTP and HTTPS requests during authentication. You can have these\r\nrequests go through a proxy server, by using the following environment variables:\r\n\r\n - HTTP_PROXY_HOST and HTTP_PROXY_PORT control how http:// requests are sent\r\n - HTTPS_PROXY_HOST and HTTPS_PROXY_PORT control how https:// requests are sent\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nOpenID for Node.js is licensed under the MIT license.
